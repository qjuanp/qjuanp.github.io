# Personal questions around CS
This is a personal list around concepts, techniques, tools, etc that I have (yes, 10 years in this area and I’m still learning)

## Principles

### SOLID
- [ ] What are its origins? Who wrote them?
Is there any other principles not included in this five group?
- [ ] What other group of principles exists? 

## Architecture Design
- [ ] What is the difference between tactics, techniques, strategies, patterns and styles in architecture design
- [ ] Is there any proven classification of Cloud patterns? Isn’t just distributed system patterns?
