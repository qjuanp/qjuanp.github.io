# Methodology

Formal, step by step

# Framework

Define a tool set to be used, it could be used all of them, some of them, or even in combination with a methodology.

# Core differences

Methodology tells you what to do, in which order, some exception cases or how to handle something that is not specifiued. A framework never tells you what to do exactly, only the tools that are available for you to handle particular scenarios or challenges.
