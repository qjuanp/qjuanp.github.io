# Methodology

This is a common used concepts among academics, with the methodology a researcher defines the procedures, methods, rules and postulates used in a particular discipline [[1]][Wikipedia-methodology]. For dissertations, the methodology explains how a particular conclussion was reached. Therefore, a methodology indicates the steps to approach a particular problem, and those steps can vary depending of the discipline.

In software, methodologies usually pre-defines the set of specific deliverables and artifacts that are needed to develop and maintain applications, as well as the sequence, inputs and outcomes during the entire software lifecycle.

In conclusion, a methodology defines what to deliver and how to create those deliverables.

# Framework

It's basically a tool set or a set of methods to be applied in certain circustances, all the tools can be used as well as just one of them from the framework.

In software use frameworks as well, frameworks like .NET (yes, dotnet core is still a framework), Java EE, Spring

Define a tool set to be used, it could be used all of them, some of them, or even in combination with a methodology.

# Core differences

Methodology tells you what to do, in which order, some exception cases or how to handle something that is not specifiued. A framework never tells you what to do exactly, only the tools that are available for you to handle particular scenarios or challenges.
